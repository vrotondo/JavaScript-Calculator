# JavaScript-Calculator
Summative Lab Part 1: JavaScript Calculator for Essentials Course 1.

I have, here, two files: One containing the JavaScript for the calculator functions and the other a basic HTML file. Access the HTML file to get to the calculator by forking this repository, cloning it, and viewing the page in the browser. It can perform basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as well as show a history of previous transactions.
